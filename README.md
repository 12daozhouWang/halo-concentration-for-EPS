# Halo Concentrations of Extended Pressâ€“Schechter

This Python script calculates the formation redshift distribution ($z_{f}$) of dark matter halos based on the conditional mass function of the excursion set theory, the mass variance ($\sigma_{M}$) of the linear density fluctuation field, and the halo concentration parameter by fitting the radial mass density distribution of TNG simulations using the NFW model. Additionally, it provides halo formation times based on the IllustrisTNG simulation merger tree. The concentration-mass relation of EPS theory is reproduced using these halo properties and their relationships. The distribution of the $z_{f}$ and $\sigma_{M}$ for the sample halos is calculated in detail within the EPS framework, following the physical processes outlined in Ling et al. (2003) and Lukic et al. (2007).
